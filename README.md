# Hello!
My name is Sydney Gruczelak and I am a recent graduate from Michigan State University. I graduated from the college of engineering with a Bachelor's degree in data science. I am actively looking for work as a data analyst/data scientist. 

Throughout my time at MSU, I learned a lot on topics like data analysis and visualization, machine learning, database systems, and much more! This website serves as a portfolio to display projects I have completed both academically and on my own time and my accomplishments thus far in my career.

# Projects
**Capstone Project, Tribal Early Childhood Research Center**

The primary goal of this project was to build an automated report generation system that takes existing data and produces reports for various audiences. The data used was obtained from student testing and it includes key features like the student’s name, age, teacher, and test scores on 4 different subtests. The reports contain basic information on student standings and progression, as well as targeted visualizations to aid in data driven decision-making. 

Working with a team of 5, we successfully automated the system to produce 4 different types of semester reports. This project not only deepened my understanding of data preprocessing  and exploratory data analysis techniques, but also provided valuable insights into early childhood research. The experience reinforced my ability to solve complex problems.

**Celebrity Face Recognition**

This project’s objective was to take the publicly available Celebrity Face dataset and utilize a pretrained model to classify a series of test images. I worked in a group of 6 to perform data separation and preprocessing, as well as model training and evaluation. We implemented the AlexNet model from the torchvision module and applied cross-entropy loss for fine tuning the weights of the model to ensure optimal accuracy.

Face recognition accuracy is obtained using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). To improve the model’s initial performance of only 5% and ensure the model adjusts the weights slowly, the learning rate was decreased from 0.001 to 0.0001. Our model’s final accuracy achieved approximately 97% accuracy.

**NFL Top Players Prediction**

This project’s goal was to predict the top performers in three key NFL positions: wide receivers (WRs), cornerbacks (CBs), and linebackers (LBs), using a dataset derived from the Player Season Stats API endpoint from SportsDataIO. I worked in a team of 5 members to uncover patterns and trends that can highlight key factors contributing to a player's success on the field. 

With this project consisting of rigorous preprocessing and feature selection, we trained and evaluated two different regression models that work well with non-linear relationships, a Gradient Boosting Regressor and a Random Forest Regressor. The Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved a higher degree of predictive accuracy, with R² values indicating a strong fit to the data – approximately 0.99 for predicting the top wide receivers and cornerbacks, and 0.95 for predicting the top linebackers. This suggests that our model can reliably predict player performance in these roles, offering valuable insights for team strategists and fantasy football participants alike.

**Life Expectancy Prediction**

The main objective of this project was to investigate what specific factors contribute to contrasting life expectancies between countries. This project uses a dataset from the world bank with data for 174 out of the 195 countries, including each country’s life expectancy and various socioeconomic standings. We live in a world with vast discrepancies in quality of life and overall life expectancy from country to country. I worked with a group of 4 on this project to investigate the reasoning for these discrepancies. A combination of data cleaning and machine learning techniques were applied to aid in grasping the answers to these questions by building a bigger picture. 

We built both regression models for predicting life expectancy and classification models for predicting a country’s region. We used an SVM regression model and achieved training and testing scores of approximately 98%. We used a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier and were able to reach training and testing scores of about 97%. For both regression and classification models, feature ranking was applied with recursive feature elimination to determine the key factors that influence a country’s life expectancy and other socioeconomic standings.
