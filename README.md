# Hello!
My name is Sydney Gruczelak and I am a recent graduate from Michigan State University. I graduated from the college of engineering with a Bachelor's degree in data science. Throughout my time at MSU, I learned a lot on topics like data visualization, preprocessing, database systems, and much more.
