# Hello!
My name is Sydney Gruczelak and I am a recent graduate from Michigan State University. I graduated from the college of engineering with a Bachelor's degree in data science. I am actively looking for work as a data analyst/data scientist. 

Throughout my time at MSU, I learned a lot on topics like data analysis and visualization, machine learning, database systems, and much more! This website serves as a portfolio to display projects I have completed both academically and on my own time and my accomplishments thus far in my career.
